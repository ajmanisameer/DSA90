Function calls itself directly or indirectly 

A RECURSIVE fn solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problem

Terminates when the base case becomes true

# Downside
Recursive fucntion uses more memory, bc the recursive fn adds to the stack with each recursive call, and keeps the values there until the call is finished
A recursive fn uses LIFO struture just like a stack

Problems to solve - Tower of Hanoi(TOH) / Inorder/ Preorder/ Postorder/ DFS of Graphs etc


printFun(test)
    {
        if (test < 1)
            return;
        else {
            document.write(test + " ");
            printFun(test - 1); // statement 2
            document.write(test + " ");
            return;
        }
    }
